The constellation of Cassiopeia 
This poem refers to the myth of Cassiopeia, who boasted about her and her daughter's beauty, which brought the wrath of poseidon. Her daughter Andromeda was chained to a rock at the sea's edge and left to be killed by the sea monster, but was saved. Later Cassiopeia was put in a similar ordeal, chained to a throne.
